FingerGo is a desktop touch-typing trainer built with Wails v2 (Go backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend). It emphasizes proper finger positioning through visual keyboard feedback, supports hierarchical text organization, and provides detailed typing analytics.

It features real-time keyboard visualization with finger mapping, customizable text libraries (plain text and code), and detailed typing statistics (WPM, accuracy, mistake tracking). 

Distributed as a Flatpak package with a clean, minimalist UI and the iconic Go gopher mascot holding a keyboard.
