FingerGo is a cross-platform desktop touch-typing trainer built with Wails v2 (Go internal layer + HTML/CSS/JS GUI). It emphasizes proper finger positioning through visual keyboard feedback, supports hierarchical text organization, and provides detailed typing analytics.

It features real-time keyboard visualization with finger mapping, customizable text libraries (plain text and code), and detailed typing statistics (WPM, accuracy, mistake tracking).

Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows with a clean, minimalist UI.
